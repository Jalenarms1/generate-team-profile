# Generate-team-profile

## Description

This application will start off asking for the manager's information and will create a starter page with all of their information that was entered.

Then, the user will be prompted to choose whether they want to add an Engineer or an Intern to their roster. AS many as they want can be added, but once they are done there is also a "Done" option to move forward with the employees added so far.

## Developer Notes

This was a fun challenge, particularly in working out the logic to dynamically generate the cards for each employee and having it be formatted correctly in the html file how it would normally be. This is a very useful application that could be further improved, as far as styling. But I am happy with the code I have written and I think it is efficient. Though, it could always be better somehow, so I take away a lot from this project going forward, and I think it will be a big help to have this experience.
